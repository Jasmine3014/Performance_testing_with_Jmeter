Jmeter_Performance_Testing


Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 13.3 And Total Concurrent API requested: 800.

300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 20 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.

400 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 26 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1600.

500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 33 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2000.

- While executed 500 concurrent request, found 0 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.00%

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 2000 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
